If you want the convenience of CodeIgniter Framework in its time and want a powerful framework like Laravel Framework then O2System Framework is the framework that is perfect for you.

The O2System Framework is designed with ease of installation, equipped with powerful features that speed you up in the development process.

### Featured Features
#### Smart Kernel
The O2System Framework is equipped with Kernel as the core, which doubles as a start-up services runner, input / output (i / o) processor, modular registry and smart services container. The kernel of the O2System Framework can be included in the Hybrid (or Modular) category because it runs multiple services at start-up and is designed with Singleton Patterns, so there is only one instance kernel executed. Remarkably, all registered services are not directly initiated unless the object service is called, this has a major impact on the reduction of memory usage.
#### Smart Autoloader
The autoloader system in the O2System Framework makes writing your code very short and efficient.
#### Smart Routing
You will be reminded with the ease of CodeIgniter Framework when creating a controller but enriched with Segment Dispatcher that allows you to address Translation by using lambda and closure.
You can also easily do Pool Address Translation and Domain Address Translation.
#### Simultaneous Parser Engine
The O2System Framework is equipped with a simultaneous parser engine system, imagine you can run Blade, Markdown, BBCode parsers simultaneously. You will also be introduced to a new parser that is very easy to write as easy as you write php code is Noodle Parser Engine.
#### Built-In User Interface
You will be surprised that the O2System Framework already has templating and theming support features even has a built-in user interface that helps you build your project built on jQuery and Bootstrap v4.0.0. If you want to build an app that requires the admin theme already available to you. If you want to build your website has been provided multipurpose theme with a charming design.
